# Pixel Artist
A simple app for doing Pixel Art on Android and having fun

Built using Android Studio

Special thanks to Marco (the Pineapple) from Spain for helping me with the Spanish translation! :)


## Features:
- Color your pixels by pressing them (duh!)
- Create, save, open and export your art (options available in the upper action bar)


## Hidden tips:
- Long pressing one of the 16 predefined colors in the lower bar will let you redefine that
- Long pressing one of the pixels will let you "pick" that color as the current one
