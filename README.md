Special thanks to Marco (the Pineapple) from Spain for helping me with the Spanish translation! :)

If you want to see some art I made with this app, there's [this channel on Telegram](https://t.me/PixelArtistAndroid). If you want to PM me to talk, feel free to message @GladiadorDePlastico :)

## Features:
- Color your pixels by pressing them (duh!)
- Create, save, open and export your art (options available in the upper action bar)


## Hidden tips:
- Long pressing one of the 16 predefined colors in the lower bar will let you redefine that
- Long pressing one of the pixels will let you "pick" that color as the current one
